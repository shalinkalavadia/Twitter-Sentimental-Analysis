# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.

:= I have followed these 3 major steps in our program:

1)Authorize twitter API client using secret keys and tokens.
2)Make a GET request to Twitter API to fetch tweets for a particular query.
3)Parse the tweets. Classify each tweet as positive, negative or neutral.
